# Product title: Inventory Management App

## Product Desciption: 
This product allows the user to input inventory information, track inventory information such as category, quantity and location of inventory. The user can also see which products need to be ordered as soon as possible, and can order the products with the push of a button. 
The purpose of this product is for a user to better manage inventory for their business, or warehouse while using only one app. This product is designed for mobile use in mind, which allows the user to update inventory information in real time. 
The main feature of this application is the entry form for inventory. This form allows users to input a product category, product name, quantity of product, minimum required product, and location of product in the store, warehouse, etc.
The secondary features are an updated display which shows the information entered into the form. This is displayed on the main webpage in one column. In the next column, inventory that is needing to be purchased is displayed.
